                    Diveagar is a great place and If you want to enjoy a weekend near beach then Its a perfect destination from Pune. Breach is very clean and nice and modarately crowded.The place with a beach very wide and clean is blessed with intense natural beauty, the tender sands below feet, coconut tree cultivations (Wadi's). And last but not the least Lord Suvarnaganesha which is the one of the main attractions of tourists visiting here. Also it's pride of the Diveagar.I enjoyed it alot.

                    I enjoyed the film.It was a horror movie.After several news reports about people quitting Roblox, a weird girl named Jenna joins high school only to stalk and creep out. However, nobody knows how much danger the world of Roblox really is in.The movie “The Oder” directed by Pankayz is based on a roblox game.The actor Zerophyx did nice work.

                    I enjoyed the film.I saw this movie recently.This movie is about freedom fighters and  about the Indian resistance fighting the British oppressors is nothing short of an epic.The great cast,the good direction and it's powerful message have made "Kranti" into a movie that can be watched over and over again. In my book that is called a classic.

                    Everyone loves a good comeback story, and 2021 saw a lot of them. From humpback whales to eastern barred bandicoots, lots of species that were either previously teetering on the edge of extinction or simply vanished (thought to be extinct) saw their populations climb back or were spotted once again in the wild.It took 30 years, but red kites have made their way back to 2,000 breeding pairs in England. This medium-to-large bird of prey was once down to just 37 breeding pairs in southern England in the mid-1990s.While still considered vulnerable, China’s giant panda is no longer endangered, thanks to years of conservation efforts. The panda population in the wild now sits at around 1,800, China says. The iconic animal’s rebound provides further confidence in conservation efforts for Chinese citizens, as many took to social media platforms to voice their joy on the occasion. The restoration of bamboo forests and habitats has also been credited with their recovery.In a remarkable turn, and despite the increasing cumulative plastic pollution and acidification problems impacting oceans, humpback whales have bounced back to an estimated 93% of their original population predating modern whaling in 1830. This comes after they nearly went extinct in the mid-20th century, declining from 27,000 to an estimated population of just 450. The population rehabilitation is largely attributed to the commercial whaling ban of 1986. A recent study estimates that the population will be “nearly recovered by 2030.”The eastern barred bandicoot also made a stunning recovery from the brink of extinction, climbing back to a population of 1,500 from 150, the result of 30 years’ worth of conservation action.

                    Antarctic research reveals link between warming and fish abundance

                    A long-term study in the Southern Ocean reveals a clear correlation between warming waters, decreased sea ice, and reduced abundance of Antarctic silverfish. These small, abundant fish are important prey for penguins, seals, and other regional marine life, in a role similar to that played by anchovies or sardines in more temperate waters.The study was published in the February 3rd issue of Communications Biology, an open-access journal from Nature Portfolio. Lead author Andrew Corso, a doctoral candidate at William and Mary's Virginia Institute of Marine Science, says "This is the first statistically significant relationship reported between sea ice and the long-tem abundance of any Antarctic fish species. With continued regional warming, these fish could disappear from the region entirely, triggering major changes in the marine ecosystem."

                    <p class="p_modal">This is not a fairy-tale. This is about real witches. Real witches don't ride around on broomsticks. They don't even wear black cloaks and hats. They are vile, cunning, detestable creatures who disguise themselves as nice, ordinary ladies. So how can you tell when you're face to face with one? Well, if you don't know yet you'd better find out quickly-because there's nothing a witch loathes quite as much as children and she'll wield all kinds of terrifying powers to get rid of them.</p>
